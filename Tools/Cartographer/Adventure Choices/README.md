# Adventure Choices

*This is a script dump and its associated files for Cartographer.*


## Overview:

It contains the adventure choices you'll use to navigate the non-board game portions.

For instance:
 - Talk
 - Move
 - Fight
 - Search

This also includes the places you'll go to and the people you'll talk to.


## How to Use:

1. Place these files in the directory:
    - `Cartographer.exe`
    - `db3_jpn.nes` *(Japanese Dragon Ball 3 - Gokuuden file)*
2. Run `db3_adventure_choices.bat`
3. Examine `db3_adventure_choices_script.txt`

## Additional Notes:

The `_[TRANSLATED].txt` file is translated, but not Atlas-ready or game-ready.

I already translated these and manually inserted them in 2019.

I will be using what's in `_[TRASNLATED].txt` to make an Atlas-ready file and use the newer translation effort from 2023 that's contained within.
