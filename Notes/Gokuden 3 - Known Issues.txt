Gokuden 3 - Known Issues

1) Certain enemy names are truncated or are wrong in battle because of the way they work.
	- Battle names in the small box need to be 7 characters or shorter, so they truncate longer names.
	- For instance, ピッコロだいまおう -> Piccolo would read as "ピッコロ -> Picc" during card selection in battle and then later "ピッコロだいまおう -> Piccolo" in text boxes to avoid the 7 character limit.
	- This creates a unique challenge for English translation because unless I find that routine in the asm, I will have butchered names.
	- Jackie Chun, who I shortened to "Chun" to fit the 7 character limit actually gets called "Krillin" in battle. 
	This is because his Japanese name ジャッキーチュン (Jackie Chun) calls him チュン (Chun) in to fit. 
	That means the shortened name pointer points 5 spaces ahead. 
	5 spaces ahead of "Chun" in my English translation is Krillin. 
	His name will correctly show as Chun in text boxes when he takes damage, as I described earlier, but this kind of error is unacceptable and so I'll have to find that routine.
