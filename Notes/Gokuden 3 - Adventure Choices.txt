Pointer Sub:
1DDA

2E 9A Pointer value (not switched) for しらべる (Investigate/Look)
 - at 0x552C4

Base Pointer (?): $525E2

Beginning of Data that Pointer table points to starts at?: 0x5BE06 
(using Pointer at 0x551FC of #24#98 --> 9824, 9824+525E2 = 5BE06)

Beginning of Adventure Choices Commands within Pointer table starts at: 0x552C4
(Pointer 2E 9A -> 9A2E+525E2 = 5C010)

Pointer table appears to end at 0x55834 with last pointer using 0x55832+0x55833

Pointer Table Pointers (unswitched):
2E9A = しらべる
359A = はなす
439A = つかう

469A = [END] (after つかう)
499A = [END] (after 3 other [END] starting at 469A pointer)
4C9A = かう (mid-たたかう starting at what would be 4A9A)
509A = [END] (after 2 other [END] after たたかう, but right before いどう)
539A = う (of いどう)
569A = [END] (3/4 after いどう)
5C9A = る (of でる)

5F9A = すすむ

ARE THERE POINTERS AT ALL?
All entries are 7 bytes, and 7 bytes are read at the expected location no matter what.
Finding the code that acts as the pointers is probably pointless (no pun intended).
The reason is that the adventure choices/commands can only fit 7 characters with the arrow anyway.
So I'll probably have to come up with <=7 character names for all adventure commands. Damn.
I could maybe write in the dakuten line if I knew how to overcome both how to write there and how to surpass the 7 character limit.
