# Card Art


## Overview

I wanted to change the original card type which was just kanji such as æ‹³ (punch, _lit. fist_) to something more readable for an English speaker.

Then I came up with the idea to use pictographs like in DBZ 3 on the Famicom.


## Example

Finding source art:

![Original Image Selection Stage - Canvas Square Divisible by 16](./Fist%20or%20Punch%20Card%20Art%20-%20Selection%20Stage%20(Canvas%20Square%20Divisible%20by%2016).png)

Then I'd take the image and shrink it to 16x16 pixels (the size of the original 4 kanji tiles).

I used Paint.NET with Nearest Neighbor so it's not any more blurred than it needs to be:

![Original Image Pixelization Stage](./Fist%20or%20Punch%20Card%20Art%20-%20Pixelization%20Stage%20(Canvas%20Square%20Divisible%20by%2016%20-%20Resize%20to%2016x16).png)

After this, you can optionally just color over the pixels with your 4-color palette.

However, I used [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzPSPj2m0Cw) by [Doug Fraker](https://www.youtube.com/@dougfraker8411) to index the picture to just 4 colors.

(I also flipped the image horizontally to represent the direction Goku faces in the game):

![Game Image Indexed to 4 Colors Stage](./Fist%20or%20Punch%20Card%20Art%20-%20Palette%20Stage%20(Simplify%20to%204%20colors%20with%20GIMP%20-%20Convert%20Image%20to%20Indexed).png)

And like I said above, I colored it to match the palette of the game:

![Game Image Finalized](./Fist%20or%20Punch%20Card%20Art.png)

Then I'd optionally check how it looks on a blank card:

![Blank Card](./Blank%20Card.png) -> ![Fist Card](./Fist%20or%20Punch%20on%20Card%20Art.png)
